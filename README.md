# gitlab-issues-export

This is a quick script written on my own code understanding for exporting the gitlab issues to a json file. 
As always this is inspired from another programming language (in this case perl) by other experts.

You may use online tools to make this into a csv file or other format, which I will try to update soon.

Please use any good code editor (VSCode for instance), to validate the json created.

Thank you.
